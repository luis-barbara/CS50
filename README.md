Final Project Description:
dxMed is an innovative web application that revolutionizes medical diagnostics through the use of interactive, specialized algorithms. This platform is designed to streamline the diagnostic process by offering a user-friendly interface that dynamically adapts to different medical specialties and pathologies. Currently, it features an advanced algorithm tailored for neurology with a focus on sleep disorders. Future updates will broaden its scope to include additional specialties and pathologies.
Project Overview: dxMed provides a sophisticated diagnostic tool by integrating interactive algorithms with a flexible web-based interface. The system collects detailed patient histories and processes this information using specialized algorithms to deliver accurate diagnostic results and recommendations. Initially focused on neurology and sleep disorders, dxMed will expand to cover more medical fields in subsequent phases.
Key Features:
1.	Specialty and Pathology Selection:
Users can choose a medical specialty from a dropdown menu. The system then presents relevant pathologies dynamically.
Each pathology is associated with specific diagnostic criteria and historical questions relevant to the selected specialty.
3.	Dynamic Clinical History Form:
A customized form is generated based on the selected specialty and pathology, designed to gather comprehensive patient data.
The form adjusts in real-time to user inputs, showing or hiding fields as necessary to streamline data collection.
5.	Algorithm-Based Result Generation:
Once the clinical history is collected, the system uses an algorithm to analyze the data according to the chosen specialty and pathology.
The algorithm processes the inputs to provide results or recommendations based on the clinical information gathered.
7.	Interactive and User-Friendly Interface:
The platform features an intuitive interface that offers real-time feedback and dynamic content adjustments.
It enhances the data entry process by providing immediate guidance, ensuring both ease of use and accuracy.
9.	Responsive Design:
dxMed is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
Technologies Used:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap
- Backend: (To be specified based on further development)
- Libraries/Frameworks: Bootstrap for responsive design, jQuery for dynamic content manipulation
Implementation Details:
- HTML/CSS: The user interface is crafted using Bootstrap and custom CSS, providing a clean and adaptable design.
- JavaScript/jQuery: Used for managing dynamic interactions, such as updating form fields and processing user inputs.
- Algorithms: Specialized algorithms analyze the collected data to generate results tailored to the selected specialty and pathology.
Usage Scenarios:
- Medical Professionals: Utilize dxMed to capture detailed patient histories and receive accurate diagnostic or treatment recommendations based on algorithmic analysis.
- Healthcare Institutions: Integrate dxMed to streamline the management of clinical data, improving diagnostic accuracy and operational efficiency.
Future Enhancements:
- Backend Integration: Develop server-side functionality to securely store and retrieve patient data.
- Advanced Analytics: Introduce features for analyzing clinical data trends and deriving insights.
- User Authentication: Implement secure login and user management features to safeguard sensitive patient information.
