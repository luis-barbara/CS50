Week 0: Introduction and Scratch
Content: Introduces programming concepts through Scratch, a visual programming language developed by MIT. Students create simple animations and games without traditional coding.
Objectives: Familiarize with programming logic, including control flow and data structures.

Week 1: C
Content: Introduction to the C programming language, covering variables, data types, operators, and control structures (if, for, while).
Objectives: Learn to write simple programs in C and understand basic programming concepts.

Week 2: Functions and Arrays
Content: Students learn about functions, including how to define and call them, as well as an introduction to arrays and strings.
Objectives: Understand code modularization and how to manage data sets.

Week 3: Algorithms
Content: Focus on algorithms and data structures, introducing concepts of time complexity along with searching and sorting algorithms (like linear search and selection sort).
Objectives: Learn to analyze and optimize algorithms for efficiency.

Week 4: Memory
Content: Introduction to memory management in C, including pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and the use of malloc and free.
Objectives: Understand how memory is used and managed in C, and learn to avoid common issues like memory leaks.

Week 5: Data Structures
Content: Covers more complex data structures such as linked lists, stacks, and queues.
Objectives: Learn how to implement and manipulate different data structures for efficient data management.

Week 6: Python
Content: Transition to Python, introducing its syntax, built-in data types, and libraries.
Objectives: Compare C and Python, and understand Python's features and advantages.

Week 7: SQL and Databases
Content: Introduction to databases and SQL (Structured Query Language), including how to create, read, update, and delete data.
Objectives: Learn to manage data using databases and perform queries.

Week 8: Web Development
Content: Covers the basics of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Students create dynamic web pages.
Objectives: Understand the structure of web applications and how to develop interactive web content.

Week 9: JavaScript
Content: Delve deeper into JavaScript for client-side scripting, focusing on DOM manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous programming.
Objectives: Learn to enhance user experience on web pages using JavaScript.

Week 10: Final Project
Content: Students work on a final project that showcases their understanding and skills acquired throughout the course. Projects can be in any domain using any combination of the technologies learned.
Objectives: Apply knowledge and skills to develop a comprehensive software solution and present it effectively.
